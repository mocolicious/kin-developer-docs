## Code Changes

If you're upgrading to Kinetic from Agora, there'll be some code changes for you to deal with.

Follow the links below to see how the Kinetic API differs from previous Kin SDK versions.

## Hosting Kinetic

When you transact with Kinetic on Mainnet, you'll need a Kinetic instance to connect to. This can be your own self-hosted instance or a 3rd party Kinetic As A Service option.

See [here](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-in-production) for more details.

## Transaction Fees

On Agora, transaction fees were paid directly by the Kin Foundation who were / are hosting the Agora service.

In Kinetic, developers will be responsible for paying for transaction fees for their own apps, unless they are using a 3rd party Kinetic As A Service provider that chooses to cover those costs as part of the service.

Support towards these payments can come from the Kin Foundation in terms of KRE payments and grant requests.

## Upgrading Keypairs

As apps upgrade to Kinetic, we recommend that developers migrate their users to the new Kinetic Keypairs.

These Keypairs are standard Solana Keypairs and give users greater control of their funds through mnemonics that allow them to access their funds with any Solana wallet. E.g. Phantom, Solflare, etc.

We recommend a process where user's Kin is moved from their previous Stellar Keypair to a new Solana Keypair.

### Step 1 - Access the existing Stellar Keypair in Kinetic

We have compatibilty tools that allow you to generate a Keypair in Kinetic from a Stellar secret.

Use the compatability tool to use your Stellar secret in Kinetic and get a Keypair.

### Step 2 - Create a new Solana Keypair

Create a new Solana Keypair with a mnemonic using a Kinetic SDK and use this as the user's new Keypair going forward.

### Step 3 - Move all of the user's Kin to the new Keypair

Use the Stellar Keypair to sign a transaction moving all of the users' Kin to their new Solana Keypair.

### Step 4 - Claim back any Sol from the empty accounts

On a monthly basis, we will pay app owners back the value of their closed empty accounts in Sol. Get in touch once you're ready to reclaim your funds.

## What If I Get Stuck?

Pop into the [`kinetic-general`](https://discord.com/channels/808859554997469244/973322547854733362) channel on Discord or one of the SDK specific channels and we'll give you a hand.
